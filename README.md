Naives Bayes Classifier used to test and predict heart data.

Probabilistic classification using statistical Naïve Bayes’ classifier
Reference: Heart disease Dataset
a) Split the dataset into training and testing set appropriately. Obtain the appropriate
contingency table from an training data set comprising the prior and posterior
probabilities.
b) Test the classifiers using k-fold cross validation technique. Run with different value
of k and then choose the optimum result.
c) Furnish the accuracy using an appropriate confusion matrix and report the
performance evaluation with different matrix (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1 score, etc.).
