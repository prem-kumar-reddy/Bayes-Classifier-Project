# Bayes-Classifier-Project
Naives Bayes Classifier used to test and predict heart data.

## Problem Statement
### Probabilistic classification using statistical Naïve Bayes’ classifier
Reference: Heart disease Dataset</br>
a) Split the dataset into training and testing set appropriately. 
   Obtain the appropriate contingency table from an training data set</br> 
   comprising the prior and posterior probabilities.</br>
b) Test the classifiers using k-fold cross validation technique. Run with different value
   of k and then choose the optimum result.</br>
c) Furnish the accuracy using an appropriate confusion matrix and report the
   performance evaluation with different matrix (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1 score, etc.).</br>
