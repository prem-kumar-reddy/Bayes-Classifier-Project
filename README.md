# Bayes-Classifier-Project
Naives Bayes Classifier used to test and predict heart data.

## Problem Statement
### Probabilistic classification using statistical Naïve Bayes’ classifier
Reference: Heart disease Dataset</br>
a) Split the dataset into training and testing set appropriately. Obtain the appropriate</br>
/tcontingency table from an training data set comprising the prior and posterior</br>
/tprobabilities.</br>
b) Test the classifiers using k-fold cross validation technique. Run with different value
of k and then choose the optimum result.
c) Furnish the accuracy using an appropriate confusion matrix and report the</br>
/tperformance evaluation with different matrix (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1 score, etc.).</br>
